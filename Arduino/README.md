# Sample code for okinesio boards

The Arduino code examples will provide snippets to get you started with the okinesio board, especially with the onboard accelerometer sensor (BMI160).


__Examples:__

- __okinesio-board_getAccXYZ__<br/>*gets the raw accelerometer axes (X,Y and Z)*

- __okinesio-board_getSteps__<br/>*gets the sensor calculated step count*

more to come ...


Some snippets contain the [Streaming library for Arduino](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/streaming/) by Mikal Hart.
You should place the file in your Arduino library folder.
