# Sample code for okinesio boards

The Arduino code examples will provide snippets to get you started with the okinesio board, especially with the onboard accelerometer sensor (BMI160).

__Upload Arduino programs:__<br/>
In order to upload sketches via Arduino IDE you need to choose __"LilyPad Arduino USB"__ as the board type.

<hr/>

__Examples:__

- __okinesio-board_getAccXYZ__<br/>*gets the raw accelerometer axes (X,Y and Z)*

- __okinesio-board_getSteps__<br/>*gets the sensor calculated step count*

more to come ...

Some snippets may contain the [Streaming library for Arduino](http://arduiniana.org/libraries/streaming/) by Mikal Hart.
If you don't have it already, you should place the downloaded library in your Arduino library folder.
